This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Router

Simple mock site created with `create-react-app` to get familiar with the react router, styled with materialize.

The app will be a mock site with placeholder text, but the main point is to familiarise myself with the react router, programmatic redirects and the other features available to us after installing the `react-router-dom` package.

### Future Work

I may add some real info and styling for a little page on Mario World, which is why I have titled it as such.
