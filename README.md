This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Router

Simple mock site created with `create-react-app` to get familiar with the react router, styled with materialize.

The app will be a mock site with placeholder text, but the main point is to familiarise myself with the react router, programmatic redirects and the other features available to us after installing the `react-router-dom` package.

### Axios

I have decided to use placeholder.JSON and axios to get some mock data onto the page, again this won't be styled or anything relevant, just to show the process.
