This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Router

Simple mock site created with `create-react-app` to get familiar with the react router, styled with materialize.

The app will be a mock site with placeholder text, but the main point is to familiarise myself with the react router, programmatic redirects and the other features available to us after installing the `react-router-dom` package.

### Features utilised

In this app I have used the `Link to` tag, the `NavLink` tag and the `Switch` tag, which are all features of the react router dom package and assist with setting up Routes and route parameters.

### Axios

I have decided to use placeholder.JSON and axios to get some mock data onto the page, again this won't be styled or anything relevant, just to show the process.

## Future Work

Right now the entirety of this site, other than image and simple headings is just placeholder stuff, but I would like to make this site have some kind of Mario theme at some point, so I have some titles/images alluding to that.
