This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Router

Simple mock site created with `create-react-app` to get familiar with the react router, styled with materialize.

The app will be based around Mario, and hold some basic information, but the main point is to familiarise myself with the react router, programmatic redirects and the other features available to us after installing the `react-router-dom` package
